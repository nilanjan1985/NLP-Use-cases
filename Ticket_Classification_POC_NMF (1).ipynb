Nowhere in their terms or fees is this noted. This is completely misleading and a scam to their customers. \\n\\nThis is a portion of a letter sent to chase and describes the issue at hand : We received courtesy access checks in the mail recently, and as XXXX, we diligently read the terms and conditions very carefully before using any financial product. Everything was clearly spelled out on the concise paperwork provided. I have attached what was in the envelope for your review. We were quite surprised then, after using one of the checks that we received a 3 % \" transaction/service '' fee of {$240.00} on the {$8000.00} check. Immediately upon seeing this on my statement I went through my files to re-read the terms and conditions of the checks, of which I still have. \\n\\nAbsolutely nowhere on the paperwork provided by Chase was there a mention of a 3 % service fee applying on anything other than balance transfers from other credit cards to Chase. I did n't hesitate in calling the number on the back of my card and after wading through the prompts to finally access a living, breathing representative. She said there was very clearly printed on the checks all the terms and conditions. I kindly let her know I had the checks right in front of me and there was no such print anywhere. She said it was in the paperwork, of which I read her the entire sheet included with the checks proving otherwise and asked to elevate the case. \\nI was transferred to a supervisor and placed on hold for over XXXX minutes while \" they brought up my account ''. XXXX ( of which she said she does n't give her last name or even it 's initial ), in XXXX XXXX told me that the terms and conditions clearly stated that I would pay a 3 % or {$5.00} service fee on balance transfers, to which I responded this check did not do. She said that it would have stated on the front of back of the check that anytime I used one I would be charged a 3 % transaction fee, to which I again stated I had the checks in front of me and even read everything they said from top to bottom. There was not even a hint at what they were telling me. She then stated the terms and conditions said a 3 % service fee anytime I used a check, to which I read her the entire box listed \" Interest and Fee Information '' off Chase 's literature included with the checks. Absolutely nowhere does it mention what they were saying was mentioned, nor could they \" access that particular document ''. She said I needed to fax Executive Offices and gave me an address and fax number before ushering me off the phone. \\nMy wife called and was given an equally frustrating runaround. She also read the entire document aloud to a representative, XXXX, a supervisor, who also stated she \" could n't locate that particular document '' to verify what my wife read was correct. XXXX stated that she had dealt with this exact issue a \" couple of times recently '', so obviously we are not the only ones who were mislead by your marketing/business practices. After getting the runaround for XXXX or so minutes my wife asked to speak to someone higher and was told XXXX was a supervisor and \" as high as you get over the phone ''. She was then issued a differing address and fax number to the one I received. \\nKeep in mind we wrote the check for {$8000.00} on XX/XX/2015 and paid the balance off on it today XX/XX/2015 before calling your representatives. Had it been stated anywhere whatsoever on your paperwork that there was a 3 % fee associated with these checks we would never have written the check. We would like the 3 % \" service fee '' removed from our account as it was never made clear in your terms and conditions that this would be charged on anything but a balance transfer.</td>\n",

       "43761  Chase is misleadingly using the wording \" Balance Transfer '' to mean everything, not just transferring a balance from one card to another. Nowhere in their terms or fees is this noted. This is completely misleading and a scam to their customers. \\n\\nThis is a portion of a letter sent to chase and describes the issue at hand : We received courtesy access checks in the mail recently, and as XXXX, we diligently read the terms and conditions very carefully before using any financial product. Everything was clearly spelled out on the concise paperwork provided. I have attached what was in the envelope for your review. We were quite surprised then, after using one of the checks that we received a 3 % \" transaction/service '' fee of {$240.00} on the {$8000.00} check. Immediately upon seeing this on my statement I went through my files to re-read the terms and conditions of the checks, of which I still have. \\n\\nAbsolutely nowhere on the paperwork provided by Chase was there a mention of a 3 % service fee applying on anything other than balance transfers from other credit cards to Chase. I did n't hesitate in calling the number on the back of my card and after wading through the prompts to finally access a living, breathing representative. She said there was very clearly printed on the checks all the terms and conditions. I kindly let her know I had the checks right in front of me and there was no such print anywhere. She said it was in the paperwork, of which I read her the entire sheet included with the checks proving otherwise and asked to elevate the case. \\nI was transferred to a supervisor and placed on hold for over XXXX minutes while \" they brought up my account ''. XXXX ( of which she said she does n't give her last name or even it 's initial ), in XXXX XXXX told me that the terms and conditions clearly stated that I would pay a 3 % or {$5.00} service fee on balance transfers, to which I responded this check did not do. She said that it would have stated on the front of back of the check that anytime I used one I would be charged a 3 % transaction fee, to which I again stated I had the checks in front of me and even read everything they said from top to bottom. There was not even a hint at what they were telling me. She then stated the terms and conditions said a 3 % service fee anytime I used a check, to which I read her the entire box listed \" Interest and Fee Information '' off Chase 's literature included with the checks.

Nowhere in their terms or fees is this noted. This is completely misleading and a scam to their customers. \\n\\nThis is a portion of a letter sent to chase and describes the issue at hand : We received courtesy access checks in the mail recently, and as XXXX, we diligently read the terms and conditions very carefully before using any financial product. Everything was clearly spelled out on the concise paperwork provided. I have attached what was in the envelope for your review. We were quite surprised then, after using one of the checks that we received a 3 % \" transaction/service '' fee of {$240.00} on the {$8000.00} check. Immediately upon seeing this on my statement I went through my files to re-read the terms and conditions of the checks, of which I still have. \\n\\nAbsolutely nowhere on the paperwork provided by Chase was there a mention of a 3 % service fee applying on anything other than balance transfers from other credit cards to Chase. I did n't hesitate in calling the number on the back of my card and after wading through the prompts to finally access a living, breathing representative. She said there was very clearly printed on the checks all the terms and conditions. I kindly let her know I had the checks right in front of me and there was no such print anywhere. She said it was in the paperwork, of which I read her the entire sheet included with the checks proving otherwise and asked to elevate the case. \\nI was transferred to a supervisor and placed on hold for over XXXX minutes while \" they brought up my account ''. XXXX ( of which she said she does n't give her last name or even it 's initial ), in XXXX XXXX told me that the terms and conditions clearly stated that I would pay a 3 % or {$5.00} service fee on balance transfers, to which I responded this check did not do. She said that it would have stated on the front of back of the check that anytime I used one I would be charged a 3 % transaction fee, to which I again stated I had the checks in front of me and even read everything they said from top to bottom. There was not even a hint at what they were telling me. She then stated the terms and conditions said a 3 % service fee anytime I used a check, to which I read her the entire box listed \" Interest and Fee Information '' off Chase 's literature included with the checks. Absolutely nowhere does it mention what they were saying was mentioned, nor could they \" access that particular document ''.

       "43761  Chase is misleadingly using the wording \" Balance Transfer '' to mean everything, not just transferring a balance from one card to another. Nowhere in their terms or fees is this noted. This is completely misleading and a scam to their customers. \\n\\nThis is a portion of a letter sent to chase and describes the issue at hand : We received courtesy access checks in the mail recently, and as XXXX, we diligently read the terms and conditions very carefully before using any financial product. Everything was clearly spelled out on the concise paperwork provided. I have attached what was in the envelope for your review. We were quite surprised then, after using one of the checks that we received a 3 % \" transaction/service '' fee of {$240.00} on the {$8000.00} check. Immediately upon seeing this on my statement I went through my files to re-read the terms and conditions of the checks, of which I still have. \\n\\nAbsolutely nowhere on the paperwork provided by Chase was there a mention of a 3 % service fee applying on anything other than balance transfers from other credit cards to Chase. I did n't hesitate in calling the number on the back of my card and after wading through the prompts to finally access a living, breathing representative. She said there was very clearly printed on the checks all the terms and conditions. I kindly let her know I had the checks right in front of me and there was no such print anywhere. She said it was in the paperwork, of which I read her the entire sheet included with the checks proving otherwise and asked to elevate the case. \\nI was transferred to a supervisor and placed on hold for over XXXX minutes while \" they brought up my account ''. XXXX ( of which she said she does n't give her last name or even it 's initial ), in XXXX XXXX told me that the terms and conditions clearly stated that I would pay a 3 % or {$5.00} service fee on balance transfers, to which I responded this check did not do. She said that it would have stated on the front of back of the check that anytime I used one I would be charged a 3 % transaction fee, to which I again stated I had the checks in front of me and even read everything they said from top to bottom. There was not even a hint at what they were telling me. She then stated the terms and conditions said a 3 % service fee anytime I used a check, to which I read her the entire box listed \" Interest and Fee Information '' off Chase 's literature included with the checks.

       "      <td>Chase is misleadingly using the wording \" Balance Transfer '' to mean everything, not just transferring a balance from one card to another. Nowhere in their terms or fees is this noted. This is completely misleading and a scam to their customers. \\n\\nThis is a portion of a letter sent to chase and describes the issue at hand : We received courtesy access checks in the mail recently, and as XXXX, we diligently read the terms and conditions very carefully before using any financial product. Everything was clearly spelled out on the concise paperwork provided. I have attached what was in the envelope for your review. We were quite surprised then, after using one of the checks that we received a 3 % \" transaction/service '' fee of {$240.00} on the {$8000.00} check. Immediately upon seeing this on my statement I went through my files to re-read the terms and conditions of the checks, of which I still have. \\n\\nAbsolutely nowhere on the paperwork provided by Chase was there a mention of a 3 % service fee applying on anything other than balance transfers from other credit cards to Chase. I did n't hesitate in calling the number on the back of my card and after wading through the prompts to finally access a living, breathing representative. She said there was very clearly printed on the checks all the terms and conditions. I kindly let her know I had the checks right in front of me and there was no such print anywhere. She said it was in the paperwork, of which I read her the entire sheet included with the checks proving otherwise and asked to elevate the case. \\nI was transferred to a supervisor and placed on hold for over XXXX minutes while \" they brought up my account ''. XXXX ( of which she said she does n't give her last name or even it 's initial ), in XXXX XXXX told me that the terms and conditions clearly stated that I would pay a 3 % or {$5.00} service fee on balance transfers, to which I responded this check did not do. She said that it would have stated on the front of back of the check that anytime I used one I would be charged a 3 % transaction fee, to which I again stated I had the checks in front of me and even read everything they said from top to bottom. There was not even a hint at what they were telling me. She then stated the terms and conditions said a 3 % service fee anytime I used a check, to which I read her the entire box listed \" Interest and Fee Information '' off Chase 's literature included with the checks. Absolutely nowhere does it mention what they were saying was mentioned, nor could they \" access that particular document ''. She said I needed to fax Executive Offices and gave me an address and fax number before ushering me off the phone. \\nMy wife called and was given an equally frustrating runaround.

       "43761  Chase is misleadingly using the wording \" Balance Transfer '' to mean everything, not just transferring a balance from one card to another. Nowhere in their terms or fees is this noted. This is completely misleading and a scam to their customers. \\n\\nThis is a portion of a letter sent to chase and describes the issue at hand : We received courtesy access checks in the mail recently, and as XXXX, we diligently read the terms and conditions very carefully before using any financial product. Everything was clearly spelled out on the concise paperwork provided. I have attached what was in the envelope for your review. We were quite surprised then, after using one of the checks that we received a 3 % \" transaction/service '' fee of {$240.00} on the {$8000.00} check. Immediately upon seeing this on my statement I went through my files to re-read the terms and conditions of the checks, of which I still have. \\n\\nAbsolutely nowhere on the paperwork provided by Chase was there a mention of a 3 % service fee applying on anything other than balance transfers from other credit cards to Chase. I did n't hesitate in calling the number on the back of my card and after wading through the prompts to finally access a living, breathing representative. She said there was very clearly printed on the checks all the terms and conditions. I kindly let her know I had the checks right in front of me and there was no such print anywhere. She said it was in the paperwork, of which I read her the entire sheet included with the checks proving otherwise and asked to elevate the case. \\nI was transferred to a supervisor and placed on hold for over XXXX minutes while \" they brought up my account ''. XXXX ( of which she said she does n't give her last name or even it 's initial ), in XXXX XXXX told me that the terms and conditions clearly stated that I would pay a 3 % or {$5.00} service fee on balance transfers, to which I responded this check did not do. She said that it would have stated on the front of back of the check that anytime I used one I would be charged a 3 % transaction fee, to which I again stated I had the checks in front of me and even read everything they said from top to bottom. There was not even a hint at what they were telling me. She then stated the terms and conditions said a 3 % service fee anytime I used a check, to which I read her the entire box listed \" Interest and Fee Information '' off Chase 's literature included with the checks.

       "      <td>Chase is misleadingly using the wording \" Balance Transfer '' to mean everything, not just transferring a balance from one card to another. Nowhere in their terms or fees is this noted. This is completely misleading and a scam to their customers. \\n\\nThis is a portion of a letter sent to chase and describes the issue at hand : We received courtesy access checks in the mail recently, and as XXXX, we diligently read the terms and conditions very carefully before using any financial product. Everything was clearly spelled out on the concise paperwork provided. I have attached what was in the envelope for your review. We were quite surprised then, after using one of the checks that we received a 3 % \" transaction/service '' fee of {$240.00} on the {$8000.00} check. Immediately upon seeing this on my statement I went through my files to re-read the terms and conditions of the checks, of which I still have. \\n\\nAbsolutely nowhere on the paperwork provided by Chase was there a mention of a 3 % service fee applying on anything other than balance transfers from other credit cards to Chase. I did n't hesitate in calling the number on the back of my card and after wading through the prompts to finally access a living, breathing representative. She said there was very clearly printed on the checks all the terms and conditions. I kindly let her know I had the checks right in front of me and there was no such print anywhere. She said it was in the paperwork, of which I read her the entire sheet included with the checks proving otherwise and asked to elevate the case. \\nI was transferred to a supervisor and placed on hold for over XXXX minutes while \" they brought up my account ''. XXXX ( of which she said she does n't give her last name or even it 's initial ), in XXXX XXXX told me that the terms and conditions clearly stated that I would pay a 3 % or {$5.00} service fee on balance transfers, to which I responded this check did not do. She said that it would have stated on the front of back of the check that anytime I used one I would be charged a 3 % transaction fee, to which I again stated I had the checks in front of me and even read everything they said from top to bottom. There was not even a hint at what they were telling me. She then stated the terms and conditions said a 3 % service fee anytime I used a check, to which I read her the entire box listed \" Interest and Fee Information '' off Chase 's literature included with the checks. Absolutely nowhere does it mention what they were saying was mentioned, nor could they \" access that particular document ''. She said I needed to fax Executive Offices and gave me an address and fax number before ushering me off the phone. \\nMy wife called and was given an equally frustrating runaround.

       "43761  Chase is misleadingly using the wording \" Balance Transfer '' to mean everything, not just transferring a balance from one card to another. Nowhere in their terms or fees is this noted. This is completely misleading and a scam to their customers. \\n\\nThis is a portion of a letter sent to chase and describes the issue at hand : We received courtesy access checks in the mail recently, and as XXXX, we diligently read the terms and conditions very carefully before using any financial product. Everything was clearly spelled out on the concise paperwork provided. I have attached what was in the envelope for your review. We were quite surprised then, after using one of the checks that we received a 3 % \" transaction/service '' fee of {$240.00} on the {$8000.00} check. Immediately upon seeing this on my statement I went through my files to re-read the terms and conditions of the checks, of which I still have. \\n\\nAbsolutely nowhere on the paperwork provided by Chase was there a mention of a 3 % service fee applying on anything other than balance transfers from other credit cards to Chase. I did n't hesitate in calling the number on the back of my card and after wading through the prompts to finally access a living, breathing representative. She said there was very clearly printed on the checks all the terms and conditions. I kindly let her know I had the checks right in front of me and there was no such print anywhere. She said it was in the paperwork, of which I read her the entire sheet included with the checks proving otherwise and asked to elevate the case. \\nI was transferred to a supervisor and placed on hold for over XXXX minutes while \" they brought up my account ''. XXXX ( of which she said she does n't give her last name or even it 's initial ), in XXXX XXXX told me that the terms and conditions clearly stated that I would pay a 3 % or {$5.00} service fee on balance transfers, to which I responded this check did not do. She said that it would have stated on the front of back of the check that anytime I used one I would be charged a 3 % transaction fee, to which I again stated I had the checks in front of me and even read everything they said from top to bottom. There was not even a hint at what they were telling me. She then stated the terms and conditions said a 3 % service fee anytime I used a check, to which I read her the entire box listed \" Interest and Fee Information '' off Chase 's literature included with the checks. Absolutely nowhere does it mention what they were saying was mentioned, nor could they \" access that particular document ''. She said I needed to fax Executive Offices and gave me an address and fax number before ushering me off the phone. \\nMy wife called and was given an equally frustrating runaround. She also read the entire document aloud to a representative, XXXX, a supervisor, who also stated she \" could n't locate that particular document '' to verify what my wife read was correct. XXXX stated that she had dealt with this exact issue a \" couple of times recently '', so obviously we are not the only ones who were mislead by your marketing/business practices. After getting the runaround for XXXX or so minutes my wife asked to speak to someone higher and was told XXXX was a supervisor and \" as high as you get over the phone ''. She was then issued a differing address and fax number to the one I received. \\nKeep in mind we wrote the check for {$8000.00} on XX/XX/2015 and paid the balance off on it today XX/XX/2015 before calling your representatives. Had it been stated anywhere whatsoever on your paperwork that there was a 3 % fee associated with these checks we would never have written the check. We would like the 3 % \" service fee '' removed from our account as it was never made clear in your terms and conditions that this would be charged on anything but a balance transfer.   \n",

       "43761    chase is misleadingly using the wording  balance transfer  to mean everything not just transferring a balance from one card to another nowhere in their terms or fees is this noted this is completely misleading and a scam to their customers \\n\\nthis is a portion of a letter sent to chase and describes the issue at hand  we received courtesy access checks in the mail recently and as xxxx we diligently read the terms and conditions very carefully before using any financial product everything was clearly spelled out on the concise paperwork provided i have attached what was in the envelope for your review we were quite surprised then after using one of the checks that we received a transactionservice  fee of on the check immediately upon seeing this on my statement i went through my files to reread the terms and conditions of the checks of which i still have \\n\\nabsolutely nowhere on the paperwork provided by chase was there a mention of a service fee applying on anything other than balance transfers from other credit cards to chase i did nt hesitate in calling the number on the back of my card and after wading through the prompts to finally access a living breathing representative she said there was very clearly printed on the checks all the terms and conditions i kindly let her know i had the checks right in front of me and there was no such print anywhere she said it was in the paperwork of which i read her the entire sheet included with the checks proving otherwise and asked to elevate the case \\ni was transferred to a supervisor and placed on hold for over xxxx minutes while  they brought up my account  xxxx  of which she said she does nt give her last name or even it s initial  in xxxx xxxx told me that the terms and conditions clearly stated that i would pay a or service fee on balance transfers to which i responded this check did not do she said that it would have stated on the front of back of the check that anytime i used one i would be charged a transaction fee to which i again stated i had the checks in front of me and even read everything they said from top to bottom there was not even a hint at what they were telling me she then stated the terms and conditions said a service fee anytime i used a check to which i read her the entire box listed  interest and fee information  off chase s literature included with the checks absolutely nowhere does it mention what they were saying was mentioned nor could they  access that particular document  she said i needed to fax executive offices and gave me an address and fax number before ushering me off the phone \\nmy wife called and was given an equally frustrating runaround she also read the entire document aloud to a representative xxxx a supervisor who also stated she  could nt locate that particular document  to verify what my wife read was correct xxxx stated that she had dealt with this exact issue a  couple of times recently  so obviously we are not the only ones who were mislead by your marketingbusiness practices after getting the runaround for xxxx or so minutes my wife asked to speak to someone higher and was told xxxx was a supervisor and  as high as you get over the phone  she was then issued a differing address and fax number to the one i received \\nkeep in mind we wrote the check for on and paid the balance off on it today before calling your representatives had it been stated anywhere whatsoever on your paperwork that there was a fee associated with these checks we would never have written the check we would like the service fee  removed from our account as it was never made clear in your terms and conditions that this would be charged on anything but a balance transfer\n",

       "29109    on sunday xxxxxxxx i visited a xxxx s restaurant for a late dinner after eating the dinner i realized i was xxxx xxxx   being very ill that evening with xxxx  and xxxx xxxx xxxx i called the next day to inform the restaurant manager who referred me to his regional manager the regional manager called and left me a message and i called several times to follow up leaving messages but never receiving a call back on wednesday xxxxxxxx i called my credit card company to inform them of the issue and they told me that they will place a hold on the charge and review it and to call back weeks later to follow up after calling back weeks later the same credit card company told me that they dont have any dispute on file that they do not permit their card holders to dispute anything against restaurants and hotels and there is nothing they can do for me in fact they only repeatedly stated that if the  service or product can not be returned in the same condition that it was provided to the customer that no dispute is permitted and the credit card will not act on my behalf  i informed them that this is contrary to the card policy in their attempt to recruit me as a customer  that they do protect their card holders from purchasing issues obviously any serious issues from hotels and restaurants are not protected for the service industry where there is high variability in quality and for those instances where a customer has been delivered compromised food andor service this policy does not protect consumers and rather gives little disincentive for restaurants to deliver subquality productsservice knowing that there are no consequences                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",

       "43761  chase is misleadingly using the wording  balance transfer  to mean everything not just transferring a balance from one card to another nowhere in their terms or fees is this noted this is completely misleading and a scam to their customers \\n\\nthis is a portion of a letter sent to chase and describes the issue at hand  we received courtesy access checks in the mail recently and as xxxx we diligently read the terms and conditions very carefully before using any financial product everything was clearly spelled out on the concise paperwork provided i have attached what was in the envelope for your review we were quite surprised then after using one of the checks that we received a transactionservice  fee of on the check immediately upon seeing this on my statement i went through my files to reread the terms and conditions of the checks of which i still have \\n\\nabsolutely nowhere on the paperwork provided by chase was there a mention of a service fee applying on anything other than balance transfers from other credit cards to chase i did nt hesitate in calling the number on the back of my card and after wading through the prompts to finally access a living breathing representative she said there was very clearly printed on the checks all the terms and conditions i kindly let her know i had the checks right in front of me and there was no such print anywhere she said it was in the paperwork of which i read her the entire sheet included with the checks proving otherwise and asked to elevate the case \\ni was transferred to a supervisor and placed on hold for over xxxx minutes while  they brought up my account  xxxx  of which she said she does nt give her last name or even it s initial  in xxxx xxxx told me that the terms and conditions clearly stated that i would pay a or service fee on balance transfers to which i responded this check did not do she said that it would have stated on the front of back of the check that anytime i used one i would be charged a transaction fee to which i again stated i had the checks in front of me and even read everything they said from top to bottom there was not even a hint at what they were telling me she then stated the terms and conditions said a service fee anytime i used a check to which i read her the entire box listed  interest and fee information  off chase s literature included with the checks absolutely nowhere does it mention what they were saying was mentioned nor could they  access that particular document  she said i needed to fax executive offices and gave me an address and fax number before ushering me off the phone \\nmy wife called and was given an equally frustrating runaround she also read the entire document aloud to a representative xxxx a supervisor who also stated she  could nt locate that particular document  to verify what my wife read was correct xxxx stated that she had dealt with this exact issue a  couple of times recently  so obviously we are not the only ones who were mislead by your marketingbusiness practices after getting the runaround for xxxx or so minutes my wife asked to speak to someone higher and was told xxxx was a supervisor and  as high as you get over the phone  she was then issued a differing address and fax number to the one i received \\nkeep in mind we wrote the check for on and paid the balance off on it today before calling your representatives had it been stated anywhere whatsoever on your paperwork that there was a fee associated with these checks we would never have written the check we would like the service fee  removed from our account as it was never made clear in your terms and conditions that this would be charged on anything but a balance transfer   \n",

       "29109  on sunday xxxxxxxx i visited a xxxx s restaurant for a late dinner after eating the dinner i realized i was xxxx xxxx   being very ill that evening with xxxx  and xxxx xxxx xxxx i called the next day to inform the restaurant manager who referred me to his regional manager the regional manager called and left me a message and i called several times to follow up leaving messages but never receiving a call back on wednesday xxxxxxxx i called my credit card company to inform them of the issue and they told me that they will place a hold on the charge and review it and to call back weeks later to follow up after calling back weeks later the same credit card company told me that they dont have any dispute on file that they do not permit their card holders to dispute anything against restaurants and hotels and there is nothing they can do for me in fact they only repeatedly stated that if the  service or product can not be returned in the same condition that it was provided to the customer that no dispute is permitted and the credit card will not act on my behalf  i informed them that this is contrary to the card policy in their attempt to recruit me as a customer  that they do protect their card holders from purchasing issues obviously any serious issues from hotels and restaurants are not protected for the service industry where there is high variability in quality and for those instances where a customer has been delivered compromised food andor service this policy does not protect consumers and rather gives little disincentive for restaurants to deliver subquality productsservice knowing that there are no consequences                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",

       "43761  chase is misleadingly using the wording  balance transfer  to mean everything not just transferring a balance from one card to another nowhere in their terms or fees is this noted this is completely misleading and a scam to their customers \\n\\nthis is a portion of a letter sent to chase and describes the issue at hand  we received courtesy access checks in the mail recently and as xxxx we diligently read the terms and conditions very carefully before using any financial product everything was clearly spelled out on the concise paperwork provided i have attached what was in the envelope for your review we were quite surprised then after using one of the checks that we received a transactionservice  fee of on the check immediately upon seeing this on my statement i went through my files to reread the terms and conditions of the checks of which i still have \\n\\nabsolutely nowhere on the paperwork provided by chase was there a mention of a service fee applying on anything other than balance transfers from other credit cards to chase i did nt hesitate in calling the number on the back of my card and after wading through the prompts to finally access a living breathing representative she said there was very clearly printed on the checks all the terms and conditions i kindly let her know i had the checks right in front of me and there was no such print anywhere she said it was in the paperwork of which i read her the entire sheet included with the checks proving otherwise and asked to elevate the case \\ni was transferred to a supervisor and placed on hold for over xxxx minutes while  they brought up my account  xxxx  of which she said she does nt give her last name or even it s initial  in xxxx xxxx told me that the terms and conditions clearly stated that i would pay a or service fee on balance transfers to which i responded this check did not do she said that it would have stated on the front of back of the check that anytime i used one i would be charged a transaction fee to which i again stated i had the checks in front of me and even read everything they said from top to bottom there was not even a hint at what they were telling me she then stated the terms and conditions said a service fee anytime i used a check to which i read her the entire box listed  interest and fee information  off chase s literature included with the checks absolutely nowhere does it mention what they were saying was mentioned nor could they  access that particular document  she said i needed to fax executive offices and gave me an address and fax number before ushering me off the phone \\nmy wife called and was given an equally frustrating runaround she also read the entire document aloud to a representative xxxx a supervisor who also stated she  could nt locate that particular document  to verify what my wife read was correct xxxx stated that she had dealt with this exact issue a  couple of times recently  so obviously we are not the only ones who were mislead by your marketingbusiness practices after getting the runaround for xxxx or so minutes my wife asked to speak to someone higher and was told xxxx was a supervisor and  as high as you get over the phone  she was then issued a differing address and fax number to the one i received \\nkeep in mind we wrote the check for on and paid the balance off on it today before calling your representatives had it been stated anywhere whatsoever on your paperwork that there was a fee associated with these checks we would never have written the check we would like the service fee  removed from our account as it was never made clear in your terms and conditions that this would be charged on anything but a balance transfer   \n",

       "29109  on sunday xxxxxxxx i visited a xxxx s restaurant for a late dinner after eating the dinner i realized i was xxxx xxxx   being very ill that evening with xxxx  and xxxx xxxx xxxx i called the next day to inform the restaurant manager who referred me to his regional manager the regional manager called and left me a message and i called several times to follow up leaving messages but never receiving a call back on wednesday xxxxxxxx i called my credit card company to inform them of the issue and they told me that they will place a hold on the charge and review it and to call back weeks later to follow up after calling back weeks later the same credit card company told me that they dont have any dispute on file that they do not permit their card holders to dispute anything against restaurants and hotels and there is nothing they can do for me in fact they only repeatedly stated that if the  service or product can not be returned in the same condition that it was provided to the customer that no dispute is permitted and the credit card will not act on my behalf  i informed them that this is contrary to the card policy in their attempt to recruit me as a customer  that they do protect their card holders from purchasing issues obviously any serious issues from hotels and restaurants are not protected for the service industry where there is high variability in quality and for those instances where a customer has been delivered compromised food andor service this policy does not protect consumers and rather gives little disincentive for restaurants to deliver subquality productsservice knowing that there are no consequences                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",

       "43761  chase is misleadingly using the wording  balance transfer  to mean everything not just transferring a balance from one card to another nowhere in their terms or fees is this noted this is completely misleading and a scam to their customers \\n\\nthis is a portion of a letter sent to chase and describes the issue at hand  we received courtesy access checks in the mail recently and as xxxx we diligently read the terms and conditions very carefully before using any financial product everything was clearly spelled out on the concise paperwork provided i have attached what was in the envelope for your review we were quite surprised then after using one of the checks that we received a transactionservice  fee of on the check immediately upon seeing this on my statement i went through my files to reread the terms and conditions of the checks of which i still have \\n\\nabsolutely nowhere on the paperwork provided by chase was there a mention of a service fee applying on anything other than balance transfers from other credit cards to chase i did nt hesitate in calling the number on the back of my card and after wading through the prompts to finally access a living breathing representative she said there was very clearly printed on the checks all the terms and conditions i kindly let her know i had the checks right in front of me and there was no such print anywhere she said it was in the paperwork of which i read her the entire sheet included with the checks proving otherwise and asked to elevate the case \\ni was transferred to a supervisor and placed on hold for over xxxx minutes while  they brought up my account  xxxx  of which she said she does nt give her last name or even it s initial  in xxxx xxxx told me that the terms and conditions clearly stated that i would pay a or service fee on balance transfers to which i responded this check did not do she said that it would have stated on the front of back of the check that anytime i used one i would be charged a transaction fee to which i again stated i had the checks in front of me and even read everything they said from top to bottom there was not even a hint at what they were telling me she then stated the terms and conditions said a service fee anytime i used a check to which i read her the entire box listed  interest and fee information  off chase s literature included with the checks absolutely nowhere does it mention what they were saying was mentioned nor could they  access that particular document  she said i needed to fax executive offices and gave me an address and fax number before ushering me off the phone \\nmy wife called and was given an equally frustrating runaround she also read the entire document aloud to a representative xxxx a supervisor who also stated she  could nt locate that particular document  to verify what my wife read was correct xxxx stated that she had dealt with this exact issue a  couple of times recently  so obviously we are not the only ones who were mislead by your marketingbusiness practices after getting the runaround for xxxx or so minutes my wife asked to speak to someone higher and was told xxxx was a supervisor and  as high as you get over the phone  she was then issued a differing address and fax number to the one i received \\nkeep in mind we wrote the check for on and paid the balance off on it today before calling your representatives had it been stated anywhere whatsoever on your paperwork that there was a fee associated with these checks we would never have written the check we would like the service fee  removed from our account as it was never made clear in your terms and conditions that this would be charged on anything but a balance transfer   \n",

       "29109  on sunday xxxxxxxx i visited a xxxx s restaurant for a late dinner after eating the dinner i realized i was xxxx xxxx   being very ill that evening with xxxx  and xxxx xxxx xxxx i called the next day to inform the restaurant manager who referred me to his regional manager the regional manager called and left me a message and i called several times to follow up leaving messages but never receiving a call back on wednesday xxxxxxxx i called my credit card company to inform them of the issue and they told me that they will place a hold on the charge and review it and to call back weeks later to follow up after calling back weeks later the same credit card company told me that they dont have any dispute on file that they do not permit their card holders to dispute anything against restaurants and hotels and there is nothing they can do for me in fact they only repeatedly stated that if the  service or product can not be returned in the same condition that it was provided to the customer that no dispute is permitted and the credit card will not act on my behalf  i informed them that this is contrary to the card policy in their attempt to recruit me as a customer  that they do protect their card holders from purchasing issues obviously any serious issues from hotels and restaurants are not protected for the service industry where there is high variability in quality and for those instances where a customer has been delivered compromised food andor service this policy does not protect consumers and rather gives little disincentive for restaurants to deliver subquality productsservice knowing that there are no consequences                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",

       "43761  chase is misleadingly using the wording  balance transfer  to mean everything not just transferring a balance from one card to another nowhere in their terms or fees is this noted this is completely misleading and a scam to their customers \\n\\nthis is a portion of a letter sent to chase and describes the issue at hand  we received courtesy access checks in the mail recently and as xxxx we diligently read the terms and conditions very carefully before using any financial product everything was clearly spelled out on the concise paperwork provided i have attached what was in the envelope for your review we were quite surprised then after using one of the checks that we received a transactionservice  fee of on the check immediately upon seeing this on my statement i went through my files to reread the terms and conditions of the checks of which i still have \\n\\nabsolutely nowhere on the paperwork provided by chase was there a mention of a service fee applying on anything other than balance transfers from other credit cards to chase i did nt hesitate in calling the number on the back of my card and after wading through the prompts to finally access a living breathing representative she said there was very clearly printed on the checks all the terms and conditions i kindly let her know i had the checks right in front of me and there was no such print anywhere she said it was in the paperwork of which i read her the entire sheet included with the checks proving otherwise and asked to elevate the case \\ni was transferred to a supervisor and placed on hold for over xxxx minutes while  they brought up my account  xxxx  of which she said she does nt give her last name or even it s initial  in xxxx xxxx told me that the terms and conditions clearly stated that i would pay a or service fee on balance transfers to which i responded this check did not do she said that it would have stated on the front of back of the check that anytime i used one i would be charged a transaction fee to which i again stated i had the checks in front of me and even read everything they said from top to bottom there was not even a hint at what they were telling me she then stated the terms and conditions said a service fee anytime i used a check to which i read her the entire box listed  interest and fee information  off chase s literature included with the checks absolutely nowhere does it mention what they were saying was mentioned nor could they  access that particular document  she said i needed to fax executive offices and gave me an address and fax number before ushering me off the phone \\nmy wife called and was given an equally frustrating runaround she also read the entire document aloud to a representative xxxx a supervisor who also stated she  could nt locate that particular document  to verify what my wife read was correct xxxx stated that she had dealt with this exact issue a  couple of times recently  so obviously we are not the only ones who were mislead by your marketingbusiness practices after getting the runaround for xxxx or so minutes my wife asked to speak to someone higher and was told xxxx was a supervisor and  as high as you get over the phone  she was then issued a differing address and fax number to the one i received \\nkeep in mind we wrote the check for on and paid the balance off on it today before calling your representatives had it been stated anywhere whatsoever on your paperwork that there was a fee associated with these checks we would never have written the check we would like the service fee  removed from our account as it was never made clear in your terms and conditions that this would be charged on anything but a balance transfer   \n",

       "29109  on sunday xxxxxxxx i visited a xxxx s restaurant for a late dinner after eating the dinner i realized i was xxxx xxxx   being very ill that evening with xxxx  and xxxx xxxx xxxx i called the next day to inform the restaurant manager who referred me to his regional manager the regional manager called and left me a message and i called several times to follow up leaving messages but never receiving a call back on wednesday xxxxxxxx i called my credit card company to inform them of the issue and they told me that they will place a hold on the charge and review it and to call back weeks later to follow up after calling back weeks later the same credit card company told me that they dont have any dispute on file that they do not permit their card holders to dispute anything against restaurants and hotels and there is nothing they can do for me in fact they only repeatedly stated that if the  service or product can not be returned in the same condition that it was provided to the customer that no dispute is permitted and the credit card will not act on my behalf  i informed them that this is contrary to the card policy in their attempt to recruit me as a customer  that they do protect their card holders from purchasing issues obviously any serious issues from hotels and restaurants are not protected for the service industry where there is high variability in quality and for those instances where a customer has been delivered compromised food andor service this policy does not protect consumers and rather gives little disincentive for restaurants to deliver subquality productsservice knowing that there are no consequences                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",

       "      <td>i hired a contractor that started working on my home he did not show up regularly the work that he was doing was horrible and he stopped showing up he charged xxxx within weeks of a project where he was only xxxx of the way through and even then all of that work that xxxx xxxx did had to be completely redone by other tilers carpenters painters and electricians and to estimate the total will be approximately xxxx and i have already paid the building department filed a citation and fine since he did electrical work that did not meet the electrical code i have submitted all of this to my credit card company chase bank and they have been horrible to work with they have recharged me for the work and are not giving me my money back \\nthis pertains to card numbers xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx visa to xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx visa to xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx visa to xxxx xxxx chase bank has not reviewed my information i have sent my quotes for future work where the contract needed to be completed bills that i had to pay for people to finish and redo the work letter from the building inspector to show that there is a violation with the electrical work and all of my walls and ceilings need to be reopened to do the work properly and in code  this is going to cost me thousands of dollars again since i just paid other contractors to drywall and repaint my walls and ceilings i had to have my new kitchen cabinets torn down to redo the electrical work chase has recharged me xxxx on my cards also they got a response from the merchant saying they do nt agree so they charged my account again of course they do nt agree  they stole xxxx they want to keep it why would i be hiring carpenters and tilers and electricians if they had finished the work at all or did qualified work why would they be cited and fined by the city if they had done their work correctly the building inspector told me to call the prosecutor because this is grand theft and fraud it is being reviewed by the prosecutor now if chase bank does not protect its customers from these shady characters that prey upon people and demand xxxx of the money even before they are xxxx of the way with the project that is a bad sign alone  these shady characters will do this again to someone else i provided all materials so it was pure profit for them they made a fortune and did not perform the work and made more money in several weeks than they did that year \\n\\nchase seems to favor the merchant they gave xxxx xxxx and xxxx xxxx billing cycles to respond and gave me about a week to respond they sent me a letter dated xxxx xxxx and it was mailed on the xxxx and it arrived approximately the xxxx i got back to town on the xxxx and they wanted it back by xxxx xxxx ridiculous unfair to the customer \\n\\nchase bank seems to be completely confused when i call and they just give canned answers and you can not talk to the same person again even if you ask for them these disputes make the customer feel like we are treated like cattle and they do not really look at the documents with any depth or understanding from the consumers standpoint and it leaves the customer with little hope even though with every call they say  i am so sorry that you are going through this and rest assured we will do all that we can to protect you  when they do nothing like that \\ni would also like to point out  who is the heck is xxxx the contract was written on xxxx xxxx and xxxx xxxx is who i hired and he did the work xxxx xxxx is also not licensed or bonded or insured  complete opposite of what he represented to me when he provided me with the contract the licensed bonded company is xxxx xxxx and they are not on my credit card very suspicious</td>\n",

       "33244  in late from my home in xxxx xxxxxxxx i began the process of applying for a mortgage to buy a home in northern xxxxxxxx i had a banking relationship with chase and after some research on rates and costs decided to get prequalified with chase before looking for properties and then working through the application process since i was between jobs having retired a year earlier from the xxxx xxxx xxxx  and about to return to work at the end of the loan officer suggested using our assets as the basis for a loan rather than wait for verification of my reappointment as a xxxx xxxx xxxx that seemed reasonable even though it was not fully explained how detailed the documentation process to verify our assets would be nonetheless we managed to comply with an endless stream of requests to help the underwriters verify our assets and provide the necessary documentation after we verified the sales contract on our house in xxxxxxxx we set a closing date for xxxx xxxx a month away and had our realtor send a copy to the loan officer so that the mortgage could be approved and in place in time for the closing scheduled to take place in xxxxxxxx we locked in the rate with the understanding from the loan officer that by moving more of our assets to chase we would qualify for discounts bringing the rate from down to with no prepaid points in order to qualify we went the through the process of moving assets to chase with assurances that we would receive the lower rate and everything would be in place in time for the scheduled closing when we departed for va a few days prior to the closing we were assured by the chase loan officers that everything needed for the scheduled closing was in place but when we arrived there we were asked to provide yet additional details about our assets we were also confronted with some new requests that we pay off some of our credit card balances  something we do every month anyway  and not use our chase branded credit cards until after the closing so as not to trigger any additional credit rating reports we also learned upon arriving in va that the settlement company had received nothing from chase and that it was unlikely that the closing could take place on schedule as we had planned despite furtive attempts to contact chase and get the information from the lender to the settlement company we were unable to close on the property as planned and faced the likelihood of us defaulting on the sales contract we were unable to get any response from chase other than a phone message apologizing for delays with underwriting and a promise from a chase loan supervisor to look into what happened we subsequently withdrew funds that we had moved to chase in order to qualify for the discounted loan and paid cash for the house not what we had intended to do but forced into this situation by chase failing to approve the loan in a timely manner and communicate properly with us ironically we discovered upon our return to xxxxxxxx chase sent the documents approving the loan via us mail not at the promised discount interest rate but at the original rate of which was not what we had been promised and which arrived to us after we had closed on the property we feel that we have been badly misled by chase about the process victimized by a bait and switch in terms of the interest rate promised and but in a very compromising position legally and financially by not being able to come through with the expected financing when it was required i have been contacted by someone at chase s executive office two weeks ago and have been playing phone tag ever since its clear to us that the processing and communications at one the nation s largest banks is terribly deficient poorly supervised and grossly irresponsible we were warned by our realtor about the challenges of dealing with large banks and the benefits of working with local lenders we had thought that our relationship with the chase branch in xxxx xxxxxxxx would assure good customer service advice and support it seems that we were wrong   \n",

       "25883  i had lost my job as an ironworker and my name wasnt on the loan where they would talk to me so after a year of writing letters to them they finally added my name to the loan last xxxx then they let me turn in mortgage assistance paper work after that they had me talking to so many different people and everytime i spoke with someone they had something different to say then the last one i talked to so it was super confusing because no one could give me a straight answer on how to get help and save my home  finally they set me up with one lady from their excecutive office to talk with she would be the only one to call me and try and help me get all the correct paper work turned in so she had talked with me for a few months and when ever the sale date got close she would call me and tell me that the sale date was pushed out to a different date so that i had time to get the correct paper work turned in well after a few months she started to tell me about more papers that i needed that i cant get right away and then she started not calling me back or awnsering my emails so i think she had just added these papers because she knew i couldnt get them right away it would take months or more which i am working on getting the but i have to go through probate now to get them and thats a long process and takes time  well now its been months sence i have been able to get a hold of her and when my govener said no forclouseres will happen untill after the first of the year no one from there will talk to me or help me try and get help getting my mortgage cought up i think they are just playing games with me i had to have an investor stop by my house to buy it to tell me that they took it all the way out of forclouser and now they have to start from the begging to start it again you think all this trouble that they are going through that they would just help me get back on track so i can start making the payments again  i have over xxxx in equity in my house and you would think they could use some of that to help me out right now im still trying to get my credit up a little bit so i can apply for my own loan somewhere else so that i dont have to deal with chase anymore but i still have a little ways to go before i will have my credit up high enough to do that so im not sure why the lady is not talking to me anymore and trying to help me get assistance i think they are just trying to steal my house so they can get the equity out of it  they did call me last year and offered me xxxx if i moved and that was not enough for me i could sell it and walk away with more then that i told them that i want xxxx and then i would walk away from the house if i sold it i could put almost xxxx into my pocket so why would i walk away with xxxx i have already had offers for xxxx for my house and that would pay off the loan pay for probate and still put a bunch of money in my pocket so i could by another place so i feel it would just be best if they helped me get back on track so they could start getting payments again on the house instead of nothing but like i said the lady that i was talking and she was trying to help is no longer talking with me no one is telling me it helping me do anything im not even sure what happen to mortgage assistance that she said i could get                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",

       "43761  chase is misleadingly using the wording  balance transfer  to mean everything not just transferring a balance from one card to another nowhere in their terms or fees is this noted this is completely misleading and a scam to their customers \\n\\nthis is a portion of a letter sent to chase and describes the issue at hand  we received courtesy access checks in the mail recently and as xxxx we diligently read the terms and conditions very carefully before using any financial product everything was clearly spelled out on the concise paperwork provided i have attached what was in the envelope for your review we were quite surprised then after using one of the checks that we received a transactionservice  fee of on the check immediately upon seeing this on my statement i went through my files to reread the terms and conditions of the checks of which i still have \\n\\nabsolutely nowhere on the paperwork provided by chase was there a mention of a service fee applying on anything other than balance transfers from other credit cards to chase i did nt hesitate in calling the number on the back of my card and after wading through the prompts to finally access a living breathing representative she said there was very clearly printed on the checks all the terms and conditions i kindly let her know i had the checks right in front of me and there was no such print anywhere she said it was in the paperwork of which i read her the entire sheet included with the checks proving otherwise and asked to elevate the case \\ni was transferred to a supervisor and placed on hold for over xxxx minutes while  they brought up my account  xxxx  of which she said she does nt give her last name or even it s initial  in xxxx xxxx told me that the terms and conditions clearly stated that i would pay a or service fee on balance transfers to which i responded this check did not do she said that it would have stated on the front of back of the check that anytime i used one i would be charged a transaction fee to which i again stated i had the checks in front of me and even read everything they said from top to bottom there was not even a hint at what they were telling me she then stated the terms and conditions said a service fee anytime i used a check to which i read her the entire box listed  interest and fee information  off chase s literature included with the checks absolutely nowhere does it mention what they were saying was mentioned nor could they  access that particular document  she said i needed to fax executive offices and gave me an address and fax number before ushering me off the phone \\nmy wife called and was given an equally frustrating runaround she also read the entire document aloud to a representative xxxx a supervisor who also stated she  could nt locate that particular document  to verify what my wife read was correct xxxx stated that she had dealt with this exact issue a  couple of times recently  so obviously we are not the only ones who were mislead by your marketingbusiness practices after getting the runaround for xxxx or so minutes my wife asked to speak to someone higher and was told xxxx was a supervisor and  as high as you get over the phone  she was then issued a differing address and fax number to the one i received \\nkeep in mind we wrote the check for on and paid the balance off on it today before calling your representatives had it been stated anywhere whatsoever on your paperwork that there was a fee associated with these checks we would never have written the check we would like the service fee  removed from our account as it was never made clear in your terms and conditions that this would be charged on anything but a balance transfer                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",

       "11689  i would like to bring to your attention what i consider to be a totally unjustified fee charged by jp morgan chase bank   chase bank    as other banks may do the same i thought you should be aware of it in case you wish to investigate the matter with chase bank or all banks \\n\\nthe fee in question is a charge whenever a personal or small business customer receives a wire transfer to his or her account to me such a charge makes no sense at all \\n\\nwhen funds are added to a customers account through a deposit by check there is both labor and risk involved in crediting the funds to the customers account labor from the banks employees receiving posting sorting and processing the check and risk from the failure of the issuing bank to transfer the funds after they have been credited to the customers account \\n\\nwhen funds are added to a customers account through a payment by wire transfer there is neither labor nor risk involved in crediting the funds to the customers account no employees are involved in processing the deposit and no lag exists between the crediting and clearance of funds  that is no risk of the crediting of funds to be reversed  \\n\\nyet chase bank charges its personal and small business customers every time a deposit is made by wire transfer into that customers account even though it involves no risk and no labor only if the customer promises to keep at least in his or her account does the bank then graciously agree to waive the fee a fee that should never have been charged in the first place \\n\\nto charge a fee to a customer to make a wire transfer is understandable but to charge a fee to a customer to receive a wire is illegitimate \\n\\nabsent any rational justification for this charge it appears to be just another way for chase bank to enrich itself at the expense of its customers this time by taking advantage of the economys move away from paper checks and toward electronic payments a move i might add that has been accelerated by the pandemic by virtue of so many more employees now working from home without access to paper checks or the required signatories \\n\\ni ask you to look into this and demand that chase bank and any other bank that imposes the same fee either justify the charge or eliminate it                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",

       "77217  hello first time doing this my fiancee has been banking at chase since she was xxxx and today all of our accounts were frozen and when we called to figure out what was going on they said all our accounts were closed we inquired as to why they had closed it and they said there was nothing they could tell us as to why our accounts were closed and offered no advice on what we can do to reconcile this situation we then went to our branch where we do all our banking and they just called the same number we called already and got the same answer we did and offered us no explanation or outcome except once our accounts are reviewed they would send a check in weeks we lost everything with this situation and no one is telling us why it happened and no one is telling us what we can do to fix it                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",

       "29782  i have been a chase banking customer with a checking account since xxxx during a month unemployment period in xxxx i had gone into arrears as preauthorized payments were not cancelled in time chase advised me of the amount and i had been paying gradually through payroll direct deposit to reduce the balance owing my account had apparently been closed in xxxxxxxx but i was able to make deposits into the account however when i filed my xxxx tax return my cpa did not change the bank information and the refund went to this closed account sometime in xxxxxxxx sometime around xxxxxxxx i was informed by the payroll department of my company that deposits into this checking account number were no longer being accepted i have not received any notice from chase that funds were deposited into a closed account the irs wrote me a letter that these funds were deposited electronically if this is the case then my overdraft should be clear and i want my checking account reopened                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",

       "21040  i have been trying to open a checking account in chase bank for my daughter and failed \\nwe are green card holders and my daughter has only a tin and doesnt have a ssn \\nafter almost two months of back and forth  in which the bank said they have a technical issue   since the first week of xxxxxxxx  the bank says now that this is a policy decision and that they do not allow green card holders to open an account if they dont have a ssn\\n\\ni know that even foreigners can open an account in the us with a tin and i think it is discriminatory for the bank not to allow my daughter to have an account just because she has a green card and a tin and no ssn yet \\nthe bank would not even speak to me anymore about this at this point                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",
       "246    i closed my chase checking account online on via chase s secure messaging system and requested to have the remaining balance sent to me by check for the amount of approximately i was told the check would be sent out within seven business days i never received the check and recontacted chase via their secure message system on to inquire on the status of my check i was told again it would take seven business days until a check would be sent out to me which i responded that i had already waited well past seven business days i was then told the next day that i needed to physically go into a chase branch to fill out a for for declaration of lost stolen or destroyed cashier s check and have it notarized i initially refused because my work schedule does not allow me to easily go to any of chase s branches however i relented after a few days due to the stress this situation was causing after going into the xxxx virginia chase branch on i waited for service for about an hour before finally speaking with a representative whose name was xxxx xxxx xxxx told me i would have to fill out the form and that i would be able to get a new check that day in the branch however after filling out all of the paperwork i was then told that i could not actually receive a check that day because i had cancelled the account online and not in a physical store this seemed absurd to me since i was physically in a chase bank and chase should be able to cancel their own checks and write their own checks or so i thought regardless i left after being told i would have my check overnighted to me most likely by tuesday  and that someone would contact me on monday  neither of these things happened additionally i contacted xxxx using the business card she gave me on my trip into the branch on the following saturday her coworker answered her phone and told me she would be busy all day and would not be able to contact me until monday i asked xxxx s coworked if she could inquire about my check to which i was told she could not and that i would have to wait until monday at this point i am very concerned that i will not be receiving my funds which i have been waiting for for nearly a month since closing my account i dont know if the incompetency of chase s checkingmailing system is something that can be fixed but i am contemplating getting a lawyer if i do not receive my check by the end of this week i have spent hours on the phone writing emails going into chase s branch etc all for the purpose of trying to get my money back this is completely unacceptable and i dont know where else to turn from here                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",
       "18203  i have been a chase bank customer for over years and recently had a few xxxx payments get reversed due to friendly fraud by a person i had a business relationship with i am an active user of xxxx and have hundreds of transactions but after two of those transactions were disputed they have chosen to freeze my account for an undetermined amount of time \\n\\nthe total amount disputed was for around but my account had a balance higher than that i do not believe its fair for me to have my other funds tied up for a long time for something that was not my fault in addition this freeze of my account has caused me to not be able to pay the credit card with chase they will not allow me to use the funds in my account in excess of the disputed amount to payoff the credit card they will also not stop charging interest while my account is frozen i can not even pay off the credit card because i can not access the online account when i try to log on it just says my account has been suspended \\n\\nif i had no other resources this would be an extremely inconvenient situation it makes no sense to deny me access to funds that are entirely unrelated to the account suspension on top of it before i realized my account was suspended i deposited at a branch they took my money and when i went to go pay my credit card bill they told me the account was frozen and i could not have the money back \\n\\nplease advise on what i should do to regain access to my money i hope i dont have to pay any penalties on the credit card due to this                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",

       "15709  i noticed that we had many atm withdraws that were not ours we are in louisiana and the withdraws were in xxxx xxxx so i ran to the bank and we went through the many withdraws they totaled about xxxx from xxxxxxxx to early xxxxxxxx when i ran to the bank they went on for weeks before i noticed i work a lot as the only one working in my family of xxxx and i am the owner of a business which keeps me very busy \\n\\nthis is my business account and im pretty much a one man operation most of the time so i dont check this as often as i probably should but the banks job is to protect my money it says so in just about every ad they show i am in the business of trying to make money to put into my accounts so they can protect it \\nnow that i saw some obvious atm fraud  and for the record no one has denied that all of this was obviously fraud  i went through the past couple months and found a few weird charges that were also not us from an xxxx in texas and a store in texas since we buy things often from other places and use the card for restaurants i hadnt noticed it but since the atm withdraws i had been really scrutinizing each item on my statement well i realized that they were fraud as well totaling about i really looked at everything and noticed them because they had a tx at the end of the item line so i thought maybe these were from texas and the bank worker said they were \\nso the bank chase bank in the next few days replaced it all and since it was all obviously fraud i was happy but then on friday xxxxxxxx a couple weeks later i saw that all the atm withdraws were reversed and the bank removed all the funds from the fraud that they returned weeks prior they removed all the money so it was like being robbed twice as you can imagine i ran back to the bank and they told me that there is a day rule that since i added the fraud charges from the xxxx   texas items from xxxxxxxx in my claim and since i didnt report those frauds within days of them happening none of the fraud would be returned or covered \\nthey never told me that they were going to remove the funds again and as much as that hurt they just removed the roughly and didnt let me know that it was gone until i found out that we hardly had anything left in the account my heart sank \\ntheres nothing worse than thinking that you have money in your business account and not knowing its gone until you find out the hard way \\n\\ni also never got an alert ever from the bank for any of these and these were daily atm withdraws for weeks in another state  ca  while i was using the card daily in louisiana that meant that they had another card and pin that matched in some way if that doesnt trigger an alert what would were were supposed to be on some sort of higher alert since we had attempted fraud charges earlier in the year and yet i never got one notice text or call like i had some yeas ago when i was out of state they called to make sure it was methis time i never heard a word from themwhy use a bank if they cant protect your hard earned money \\n\\nso because i found some more obscure fraud a few months back after these seeing these obvious atm ones  and there were no fraud charges between the texas ones in xxxx and the atm withdraws in xxxx  i am not covered in any way i lose it all i thought i was helping by looking into the past months now i regret it im out about which is critical for us all due to fraud and my bank has gives no alerts or notifications to let me know that they are being compromised with a fake bank card in another state while i use the card daily here in my state and i have no recourse why would i use a bank to protect my money if its so easily taken and no one seems to care it maddening i am better off keeping it out of the bank at least then i know i am watching it                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",
       "7538   i opened a checking and savings account online with chase on everything went well and i got welcome email dated and physical welcome letter from them in following week i also received debit card associated with my checking account surprisingly i also received a letter the same day from the chase saying the accounts were closed that was dated i tried to log in to the account online and it said the account is closed and a customer service number was mentioned to contact for further details when i called the number the agent said i need to go to a branch for verification i was surprised the agent said that account might have been closed if i did not respond to the verification call they must have made before closure and i am certain that i did not receive any calls from chase before i visited the branch the very next day ie they tried to look into the matter and said they can not find a specific reason for account closure but the accounts are closed and cant be reopened the only solution i was given was a new one the problem was that i opened the accounts with a promotional offer of xxxx  when you open a new account to chase  checking and savings subsequentlythe promotion was valid until i requested the manager if they can give me the same promotion they asked me to come next day ie so that the agent can ask the specifics from the manager i did call in before going to ask if same promotions will be added they said yes but due to some reason i missed going the said day instead i planned to go i called in again before going to the bank and the representative who was dealing with me had been moved to another location i requested the agent on call with the complete details to make sure my trip to bank is not wasted and she suggested to call me back i heard back from her and she said the manager was in meeting and she can only contact the manager after the meeting i asked her politely to give me a call even if the answer was no but i never received a call back from her or the bank i felt no point in contacting the bank again this is how chase closed my accounts without any proper justification or giving any time to fix something that was missing and cheat me out of a great promotion                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",

       "      <td>in late from my home in xxxx xxxxxxxx i began the process of applying for a mortgage to buy a home in northern xxxxxxxx i had a banking relationship with chase and after some research on rates and costs decided to get prequalified with chase before looking for properties and then working through the application process since i was between jobs having retired a year earlier from the xxxx xxxx xxxx  and about to return to work at the end of the loan officer suggested using our assets as the basis for a loan rather than wait for verification of my reappointment as a xxxx xxxx xxxx that seemed reasonable even though it was not fully explained how detailed the documentation process to verify our assets would be nonetheless we managed to comply with an endless stream of requests to help the underwriters verify our assets and provide the necessary documentation after we verified the sales contract on our house in xxxxxxxx we set a closing date for xxxx xxxx a month away and had our realtor send a copy to the loan officer so that the mortgage could be approved and in place in time for the closing scheduled to take place in xxxxxxxx we locked in the rate with the understanding from the loan officer that by moving more of our assets to chase we would qualify for discounts bringing the rate from down to with no prepaid points in order to qualify we went the through the process of moving assets to chase with assurances that we would receive the lower rate and everything would be in place in time for the scheduled closing when we departed for va a few days prior to the closing we were assured by the chase loan officers that everything needed for the scheduled closing was in place but when we arrived there we were asked to provide yet additional details about our assets we were also confronted with some new requests that we pay off some of our credit card balances  something we do every month anyway  and not use our chase branded credit cards until after the closing so as not to trigger any additional credit rating reports we also learned upon arriving in va that the settlement company had received nothing from chase and that it was unlikely that the closing could take place on schedule as we had planned despite furtive attempts to contact chase and get the information from the lender to the settlement company we were unable to close on the property as planned and faced the likelihood of us defaulting on the sales contract we were unable to get any response from chase other than a phone message apologizing for delays with underwriting and a promise from a chase loan supervisor to look into what happened we subsequently withdrew funds that we had moved to chase in order to qualify for the discounted loan and paid cash for the house not what we had intended to do but forced into this situation by chase failing to approve the loan in a timely manner and communicate properly with us ironically we discovered upon our return to xxxxxxxx chase sent the documents approving the loan via us mail not at the promised discount interest rate but at the original rate of which was not what we had been promised and which arrived to us after we had closed on the property we feel that we have been badly misled by chase about the process victimized by a bait and switch in terms of the interest rate promised and but in a very compromising position legally and financially by not being able to come through with the expected financing when it was required i have been contacted by someone at chase s executive office two weeks ago and have been playing phone tag ever since its clear to us that the processing and communications at one the nation s largest banks is terribly deficient poorly supervised and grossly irresponsible we were warned by our realtor about the challenges of dealing with large banks and the benefits of working with local lenders we had thought that our relationship with the chase branch in xxxx xxxxxxxx would assure good customer service advice and support it seems that we were wrong</td>\n",

       "29925  on xxxx xxxx i charged for xxxx xxxx despite insufficient funds and chase accepted the transaction only to gauge me with in overdraft fees so again chase has overdrafted me despite my opting out  this is now like the xxxx and xxxx time  of overdraft coverage now this time is a little different because it says in the overdraft fee that the xxxx charges were repeating charges but this ca nt be the end of the story because xxxx checks every card it uses to authorize it when it uses it it s simply a slippery way for chase to make an obscene amount of money off of a broke college student again  of course they always check that s how the transaction gets processed they have to because the charge is variable just like a xxxx purchase  it is not a uniform repeating charge and chase s advertising is both slippery and false and difficult to understand for the average consumer in this context i do nt have the means to pay the extra charges and the xxxx should ve been denied i would ve just used my other card  xxxx  had i known that i needless to say i will be using another bank after this issue gets resolved or a credit union \\n\\nand i understand that xxxx charges are variable and that makes the whole thing more complicated but it turns out i had well under the minimum xxxx charge in my account and so the transaction should ve been denied                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",

       "53740  on xxxxxxxx i purchased a scooter from a scooter dealer named xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx of xxxx delivered the bike to me the evening of xxxxxxxx as he removed the bike from his truck he mentioned it was making a noise when he test drove it but since the bike had a year warranty to drive it and see if it would work itself out he was not gone minutes and i notice a cable dangling from below the bike i snapped a photo and sent him a text asking him if this was supposed to be hanging like this he never responded so i pushed the cable up inside the bike with my hand hoping it went where it was supposed to go the same evening i notice the bike making a terrible rattling noise i took a video and sent it to him and his reply was  get some electrical tape and tape it up to muffle the noise  i decided to call him the following day  thursday xxxxxxxx  and he begins insulting me and telling me to  just drive the xxxx thing xxxxxxxx miles before i call him  he says that i am seeking perfection and i am not going to get perfection from a plastic scooter the following saturday xxxxxxxx we contact xxxx xxxx again and this time he begins to threaten us with saying that he is an xxxx and does not take any  xxxx   we are in disbelief that we are being treated this way on monday xxxxxxxx i decide to contact chase and tell them what is transpiring with this merchant chase recommends that i have the bike delivered back to the merchant i contact a professional motorcycle towing company and pay then to have my bike redelivered back on thursday xxxxxxxx to the merchant per chase s recommendation so that they can apply a charge back the merchant went ballistic and threatened to slash the motorcycle towing company s tires who were hired to deliver back the bikes the same day i receive an email from this merchant saying that he now has my bike and will be charging me  xxxx day plus additional fee s and will not release the merchandise until it is picked up in person with all fee s paid and also threatens to put the bike in the city pound he very well could have chose to look at the bike while he had it now back in his possession but instead decides to be ugly and hold my bike hostage after he received chases back charges after the merchant has his bike back he continues to send me threatening emails i continued to send chase every email he had sent to keep them informed that he was holding the merchandise for ransom after the bike is now back with merchant chase sends me a letter telling me that they now need a opinion letter on the merchandise in order to continue the dispute i explain to chase that the merchant has chosen to be ugly and will not release the bike for a second opinion i after all the bike was sent back because chase asked me to send it back to the merchant although chase was well aware that the merchant was not going to work with me nor give me back my bike because i can not get a opinion letter for my bike chase reverses the charges back to my card so now the merchant has my bike and i am out for merchandise i do not have i am at a total loss and find it very difficult that chase can not see the position that they placed me in when they asked me to return the bike and not expect me to pay for something i do not have i refuse to pay for something i do not have the bike was never registered in my name i have no title i have no contract from this merchant i merely have a sales slip for my purchase in the amount of after doing additional background research on this dealer i learn he is a convicted felon  and to be honest i am now afraid to confront him for my own safety in summary chase bank should have told me initially that a opinion letter was needed before they told me to return the bike                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",

       "29109  on sunday xxxxxxxx i visited a xxxx s restaurant for a late dinner after eating the dinner i realized i was xxxx xxxx   being very ill that evening with xxxx  and xxxx xxxx xxxx i called the next day to inform the restaurant manager who referred me to his regional manager the regional manager called and left me a message and i called several times to follow up leaving messages but never receiving a call back on wednesday xxxxxxxx i called my credit card company to inform them of the issue and they told me that they will place a hold on the charge and review it and to call back weeks later to follow up after calling back weeks later the same credit card company told me that they dont have any dispute on file that they do not permit their card holders to dispute anything against restaurants and hotels and there is nothing they can do for me in fact they only repeatedly stated that if the  service or product can not be returned in the same condition that it was provided to the customer that no dispute is permitted and the credit card will not act on my behalf  i informed them that this is contrary to the card policy in their attempt to recruit me as a customer  that they do protect their card holders from purchasing issues obviously any serious issues from hotels and restaurants are not protected for the service industry where there is high variability in quality and for those instances where a customer has been delivered compromised food andor service this policy does not protect consumers and rather gives little disincentive for restaurants to deliver subquality productsservice knowing that there are no consequences                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",

       "43761  chase is misleadingly using the wording  balance transfer  to mean everything not just transferring a balance from one card to another nowhere in their terms or fees is this noted this is completely misleading and a scam to their customers \\n\\nthis is a portion of a letter sent to chase and describes the issue at hand  we received courtesy access checks in the mail recently and as xxxx we diligently read the terms and conditions very carefully before using any financial product everything was clearly spelled out on the concise paperwork provided i have attached what was in the envelope for your review we were quite surprised then after using one of the checks that we received a transactionservice  fee of on the check immediately upon seeing this on my statement i went through my files to reread the terms and conditions of the checks of which i still have \\n\\nabsolutely nowhere on the paperwork provided by chase was there a mention of a service fee applying on anything other than balance transfers from other credit cards to chase i did nt hesitate in calling the number on the back of my card and after wading through the prompts to finally access a living breathing representative she said there was very clearly printed on the checks all the terms and conditions i kindly let her know i had the checks right in front of me and there was no such print anywhere she said it was in the paperwork of which i read her the entire sheet included with the checks proving otherwise and asked to elevate the case \\ni was transferred to a supervisor and placed on hold for over xxxx minutes while  they brought up my account  xxxx  of which she said she does nt give her last name or even it s initial  in xxxx xxxx told me that the terms and conditions clearly stated that i would pay a or service fee on balance transfers to which i responded this check did not do she said that it would have stated on the front of back of the check that anytime i used one i would be charged a transaction fee to which i again stated i had the checks in front of me and even read everything they said from top to bottom there was not even a hint at what they were telling me she then stated the terms and conditions said a service fee anytime i used a check to which i read her the entire box listed  interest and fee information  off chase s literature included with the checks absolutely nowhere does it mention what they were saying was mentioned nor could they  access that particular document  she said i needed to fax executive offices and gave me an address and fax number before ushering me off the phone \\nmy wife called and was given an equally frustrating runaround she also read the entire document aloud to a representative xxxx a supervisor who also stated she  could nt locate that particular document  to verify what my wife read was correct xxxx stated that she had dealt with this exact issue a  couple of times recently  so obviously we are not the only ones who were mislead by your marketingbusiness practices after getting the runaround for xxxx or so minutes my wife asked to speak to someone higher and was told xxxx was a supervisor and  as high as you get over the phone  she was then issued a differing address and fax number to the one i received \\nkeep in mind we wrote the check for on and paid the balance off on it today before calling your representatives had it been stated anywhere whatsoever on your paperwork that there was a fee associated with these checks we would never have written the check we would like the service fee  removed from our account as it was never made clear in your terms and conditions that this would be charged on anything but a balance transfer                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",

       "11689  i would like to bring to your attention what i consider to be a totally unjustified fee charged by jp morgan chase bank   chase bank    as other banks may do the same i thought you should be aware of it in case you wish to investigate the matter with chase bank or all banks \\n\\nthe fee in question is a charge whenever a personal or small business customer receives a wire transfer to his or her account to me such a charge makes no sense at all \\n\\nwhen funds are added to a customers account through a deposit by check there is both labor and risk involved in crediting the funds to the customers account labor from the banks employees receiving posting sorting and processing the check and risk from the failure of the issuing bank to transfer the funds after they have been credited to the customers account \\n\\nwhen funds are added to a customers account through a payment by wire transfer there is neither labor nor risk involved in crediting the funds to the customers account no employees are involved in processing the deposit and no lag exists between the crediting and clearance of funds  that is no risk of the crediting of funds to be reversed  \\n\\nyet chase bank charges its personal and small business customers every time a deposit is made by wire transfer into that customers account even though it involves no risk and no labor only if the customer promises to keep at least in his or her account does the bank then graciously agree to waive the fee a fee that should never have been charged in the first place \\n\\nto charge a fee to a customer to make a wire transfer is understandable but to charge a fee to a customer to receive a wire is illegitimate \\n\\nabsent any rational justification for this charge it appears to be just another way for chase bank to enrich itself at the expense of its customers this time by taking advantage of the economys move away from paper checks and toward electronic payments a move i might add that has been accelerated by the pandemic by virtue of so many more employees now working from home without access to paper checks or the required signatories \\n\\ni ask you to look into this and demand that chase bank and any other bank that imposes the same fee either justify the charge or eliminate it                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",

       "33244  in late from my home in xxxx xxxxxxxx i began the process of applying for a mortgage to buy a home in northern xxxxxxxx i had a banking relationship with chase and after some research on rates and costs decided to get prequalified with chase before looking for properties and then working through the application process since i was between jobs having retired a year earlier from the xxxx xxxx xxxx  and about to return to work at the end of the loan officer suggested using our assets as the basis for a loan rather than wait for verification of my reappointment as a xxxx xxxx xxxx that seemed reasonable even though it was not fully explained how detailed the documentation process to verify our assets would be nonetheless we managed to comply with an endless stream of requests to help the underwriters verify our assets and provide the necessary documentation after we verified the sales contract on our house in xxxxxxxx we set a closing date for xxxx xxxx a month away and had our realtor send a copy to the loan officer so that the mortgage could be approved and in place in time for the closing scheduled to take place in xxxxxxxx we locked in the rate with the understanding from the loan officer that by moving more of our assets to chase we would qualify for discounts bringing the rate from down to with no prepaid points in order to qualify we went the through the process of moving assets to chase with assurances that we would receive the lower rate and everything would be in place in time for the scheduled closing when we departed for va a few days prior to the closing we were assured by the chase loan officers that everything needed for the scheduled closing was in place but when we arrived there we were asked to provide yet additional details about our assets we were also confronted with some new requests that we pay off some of our credit card balances  something we do every month anyway  and not use our chase branded credit cards until after the closing so as not to trigger any additional credit rating reports we also learned upon arriving in va that the settlement company had received nothing from chase and that it was unlikely that the closing could take place on schedule as we had planned despite furtive attempts to contact chase and get the information from the lender to the settlement company we were unable to close on the property as planned and faced the likelihood of us defaulting on the sales contract we were unable to get any response from chase other than a phone message apologizing for delays with underwriting and a promise from a chase loan supervisor to look into what happened we subsequently withdrew funds that we had moved to chase in order to qualify for the discounted loan and paid cash for the house not what we had intended to do but forced into this situation by chase failing to approve the loan in a timely manner and communicate properly with us ironically we discovered upon our return to xxxxxxxx chase sent the documents approving the loan via us mail not at the promised discount interest rate but at the original rate of which was not what we had been promised and which arrived to us after we had closed on the property we feel that we have been badly misled by chase about the process victimized by a bait and switch in terms of the interest rate promised and but in a very compromising position legally and financially by not being able to come through with the expected financing when it was required i have been contacted by someone at chase s executive office two weeks ago and have been playing phone tag ever since its clear to us that the processing and communications at one the nation s largest banks is terribly deficient poorly supervised and grossly irresponsible we were warned by our realtor about the challenges of dealing with large banks and the benefits of working with local lenders we had thought that our relationship with the chase branch in xxxx xxxxxxxx would assure good customer service advice and support it seems that we were wrong   \n",

       "43761  chase is misleadingly using the wording  balance transfer  to mean everything not just transferring a balance from one card to another nowhere in their terms or fees is this noted this is completely misleading and a scam to their customers \\n\\nthis is a portion of a letter sent to chase and describes the issue at hand  we received courtesy access checks in the mail recently and as xxxx we diligently read the terms and conditions very carefully before using any financial product everything was clearly spelled out on the concise paperwork provided i have attached what was in the envelope for your review we were quite surprised then after using one of the checks that we received a transactionservice  fee of on the check immediately upon seeing this on my statement i went through my files to reread the terms and conditions of the checks of which i still have \\n\\nabsolutely nowhere on the paperwork provided by chase was there a mention of a service fee applying on anything other than balance transfers from other credit cards to chase i did nt hesitate in calling the number on the back of my card and after wading through the prompts to finally access a living breathing representative she said there was very clearly printed on the checks all the terms and conditions i kindly let her know i had the checks right in front of me and there was no such print anywhere she said it was in the paperwork of which i read her the entire sheet included with the checks proving otherwise and asked to elevate the case \\ni was transferred to a supervisor and placed on hold for over xxxx minutes while  they brought up my account  xxxx  of which she said she does nt give her last name or even it s initial  in xxxx xxxx told me that the terms and conditions clearly stated that i would pay a or service fee on balance transfers to which i responded this check did not do she said that it would have stated on the front of back of the check that anytime i used one i would be charged a transaction fee to which i again stated i had the checks in front of me and even read everything they said from top to bottom there was not even a hint at what they were telling me she then stated the terms and conditions said a service fee anytime i used a check to which i read her the entire box listed  interest and fee information  off chase s literature included with the checks absolutely nowhere does it mention what they were saying was mentioned nor could they  access that particular document  she said i needed to fax executive offices and gave me an address and fax number before ushering me off the phone \\nmy wife called and was given an equally frustrating runaround she also read the entire document aloud to a representative xxxx a supervisor who also stated she  could nt locate that particular document  to verify what my wife read was correct xxxx stated that she had dealt with this exact issue a  couple of times recently  so obviously we are not the only ones who were mislead by your marketingbusiness practices after getting the runaround for xxxx or so minutes my wife asked to speak to someone higher and was told xxxx was a supervisor and  as high as you get over the phone  she was then issued a differing address and fax number to the one i received \\nkeep in mind we wrote the check for on and paid the balance off on it today before calling your representatives had it been stated anywhere whatsoever on your paperwork that there was a fee associated with these checks we would never have written the check we would like the service fee  removed from our account as it was never made clear in your terms and conditions that this would be charged on anything but a balance transfer   \n",

       "29109  on sunday xxxxxxxx i visited a xxxx s restaurant for a late dinner after eating the dinner i realized i was xxxx xxxx   being very ill that evening with xxxx  and xxxx xxxx xxxx i called the next day to inform the restaurant manager who referred me to his regional manager the regional manager called and left me a message and i called several times to follow up leaving messages but never receiving a call back on wednesday xxxxxxxx i called my credit card company to inform them of the issue and they told me that they will place a hold on the charge and review it and to call back weeks later to follow up after calling back weeks later the same credit card company told me that they dont have any dispute on file that they do not permit their card holders to dispute anything against restaurants and hotels and there is nothing they can do for me in fact they only repeatedly stated that if the  service or product can not be returned in the same condition that it was provided to the customer that no dispute is permitted and the credit card will not act on my behalf  i informed them that this is contrary to the card policy in their attempt to recruit me as a customer  that they do protect their card holders from purchasing issues obviously any serious issues from hotels and restaurants are not protected for the service industry where there is high variability in quality and for those instances where a customer has been delivered compromised food andor service this policy does not protect consumers and rather gives little disincentive for restaurants to deliver subquality productsservice knowing that there are no consequences                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",

       "43761  chase is misleadingly using the wording  balance transfer  to mean everything not just transferring a balance from one card to another nowhere in their terms or fees is this noted this is completely misleading and a scam to their customers \\n\\nthis is a portion of a letter sent to chase and describes the issue at hand  we received courtesy access checks in the mail recently and as xxxx we diligently read the terms and conditions very carefully before using any financial product everything was clearly spelled out on the concise paperwork provided i have attached what was in the envelope for your review we were quite surprised then after using one of the checks that we received a transactionservice  fee of on the check immediately upon seeing this on my statement i went through my files to reread the terms and conditions of the checks of which i still have \\n\\nabsolutely nowhere on the paperwork provided by chase was there a mention of a service fee applying on anything other than balance transfers from other credit cards to chase i did nt hesitate in calling the number on the back of my card and after wading through the prompts to finally access a living breathing representative she said there was very clearly printed on the checks all the terms and conditions i kindly let her know i had the checks right in front of me and there was no such print anywhere she said it was in the paperwork of which i read her the entire sheet included with the checks proving otherwise and asked to elevate the case \\ni was transferred to a supervisor and placed on hold for over xxxx minutes while  they brought up my account  xxxx  of which she said she does nt give her last name or even it s initial  in xxxx xxxx told me that the terms and conditions clearly stated that i would pay a or service fee on balance transfers to which i responded this check did not do she said that it would have stated on the front of back of the check that anytime i used one i would be charged a transaction fee to which i again stated i had the checks in front of me and even read everything they said from top to bottom there was not even a hint at what they were telling me she then stated the terms and conditions said a service fee anytime i used a check to which i read her the entire box listed  interest and fee information  off chase s literature included with the checks absolutely nowhere does it mention what they were saying was mentioned nor could they  access that particular document  she said i needed to fax executive offices and gave me an address and fax number before ushering me off the phone \\nmy wife called and was given an equally frustrating runaround she also read the entire document aloud to a representative xxxx a supervisor who also stated she  could nt locate that particular document  to verify what my wife read was correct xxxx stated that she had dealt with this exact issue a  couple of times recently  so obviously we are not the only ones who were mislead by your marketingbusiness practices after getting the runaround for xxxx or so minutes my wife asked to speak to someone higher and was told xxxx was a supervisor and  as high as you get over the phone  she was then issued a differing address and fax number to the one i received \\nkeep in mind we wrote the check for on and paid the balance off on it today before calling your representatives had it been stated anywhere whatsoever on your paperwork that there was a fee associated with these checks we would never have written the check we would like the service fee  removed from our account as it was never made clear in your terms and conditions that this would be charged on anything but a balance transfer   \n",

       "29109  on sunday xxxxxxxx i visited a xxxx s restaurant for a late dinner after eating the dinner i realized i was xxxx xxxx   being very ill that evening with xxxx  and xxxx xxxx xxxx i called the next day to inform the restaurant manager who referred me to his regional manager the regional manager called and left me a message and i called several times to follow up leaving messages but never receiving a call back on wednesday xxxxxxxx i called my credit card company to inform them of the issue and they told me that they will place a hold on the charge and review it and to call back weeks later to follow up after calling back weeks later the same credit card company told me that they dont have any dispute on file that they do not permit their card holders to dispute anything against restaurants and hotels and there is nothing they can do for me in fact they only repeatedly stated that if the  service or product can not be returned in the same condition that it was provided to the customer that no dispute is permitted and the credit card will not act on my behalf  i informed them that this is contrary to the card policy in their attempt to recruit me as a customer  that they do protect their card holders from purchasing issues obviously any serious issues from hotels and restaurants are not protected for the service industry where there is high variability in quality and for those instances where a customer has been delivered compromised food andor service this policy does not protect consumers and rather gives little disincentive for restaurants to deliver subquality productsservice knowing that there are no consequences                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",

       "      <td>chase is misleadingly using the wording  balance transfer  to mean everything not just transferring a balance from one card to another nowhere in their terms or fees is this noted this is completely misleading and a scam to their customers \\n\\nthis is a portion of a letter sent to chase and describes the issue at hand  we received courtesy access checks in the mail recently and as xxxx we diligently read the terms and conditions very carefully before using any financial product everything was clearly spelled out on the concise paperwork provided i have attached what was in the envelope for your review we were quite surprised then after using one of the checks that we received a transactionservice  fee of on the check immediately upon seeing this on my statement i went through my files to reread the terms and conditions of the checks of which i still have \\n\\nabsolutely nowhere on the paperwork provided by chase was there a mention of a service fee applying on anything other than balance transfers from other credit cards to chase i did nt hesitate in calling the number on the back of my card and after wading through the prompts to finally access a living breathing representative she said there was very clearly printed on the checks all the terms and conditions i kindly let her know i had the checks right in front of me and there was no such print anywhere she said it was in the paperwork of which i read her the entire sheet included with the checks proving otherwise and asked to elevate the case \\ni was transferred to a supervisor and placed on hold for over xxxx minutes while  they brought up my account  xxxx  of which she said she does nt give her last name or even it s initial  in xxxx xxxx told me that the terms and conditions clearly stated that i would pay a or service fee on balance transfers to which i responded this check did not do she said that it would have stated on the front of back of the check that anytime i used one i would be charged a transaction fee to which i again stated i had the checks in front of me and even read everything they said from top to bottom there was not even a hint at what they were telling me she then stated the terms and conditions said a service fee anytime i used a check to which i read her the entire box listed  interest and fee information  off chase s literature included with the checks absolutely nowhere does it mention what they were saying was mentioned nor could they  access that particular document  she said i needed to fax executive offices and gave me an address and fax number before ushering me off the phone \\nmy wife called and was given an equally frustrating runaround she also read the entire document aloud to a representative xxxx a supervisor who also stated she  could nt locate that particular document  to verify what my wife read was correct xxxx stated that she had dealt with this exact issue a  couple of times recently  so obviously we are not the only ones who were mislead by your marketingbusiness practices after getting the runaround for xxxx or so minutes my wife asked to speak to someone higher and was told xxxx was a supervisor and  as high as you get over the phone  she was then issued a differing address and fax number to the one i received \\nkeep in mind we wrote the check for on and paid the balance off on it today before calling your representatives had it been stated anywhere whatsoever on your paperwork that there was a fee associated with these checks we would never have written the check we would like the service fee  removed from our account as it was never made clear in your terms and conditions that this would be charged on anything but a balance transfer</td>\n",

       "43761  chase is misleadingly using the wording  balance transfer  to mean everything not just transferring a balance from one card to another nowhere in their terms or fees is this noted this is completely misleading and a scam to their customers \\n\\nthis is a portion of a letter sent to chase and describes the issue at hand  we received courtesy access checks in the mail recently and as xxxx we diligently read the terms and conditions very carefully before using any financial product everything was clearly spelled out on the concise paperwork provided i have attached what was in the envelope for your review we were quite surprised then after using one of the checks that we received a transactionservice  fee of on the check immediately upon seeing this on my statement i went through my files to reread the terms and conditions of the checks of which i still have \\n\\nabsolutely nowhere on the paperwork provided by chase was there a mention of a service fee applying on anything other than balance transfers from other credit cards to chase i did nt hesitate in calling the number on the back of my card and after wading through the prompts to finally access a living breathing representative she said there was very clearly printed on the checks all the terms and conditions i kindly let her know i had the checks right in front of me and there was no such print anywhere she said it was in the paperwork of which i read her the entire sheet included with the checks proving otherwise and asked to elevate the case \\ni was transferred to a supervisor and placed on hold for over xxxx minutes while  they brought up my account  xxxx  of which she said she does nt give her last name or even it s initial  in xxxx xxxx told me that the terms and conditions clearly stated that i would pay a or service fee on balance transfers to which i responded this check did not do she said that it would have stated on the front of back of the check that anytime i used one i would be charged a transaction fee to which i again stated i had the checks in front of me and even read everything they said from top to bottom there was not even a hint at what they were telling me she then stated the terms and conditions said a service fee anytime i used a check to which i read her the entire box listed  interest and fee information  off chase s literature included with the checks absolutely nowhere does it mention what they were saying was mentioned nor could they  access that particular document  she said i needed to fax executive offices and gave me an address and fax number before ushering me off the phone \\nmy wife called and was given an equally frustrating runaround she also read the entire document aloud to a representative xxxx a supervisor who also stated she  could nt locate that particular document  to verify what my wife read was correct xxxx stated that she had dealt with this exact issue a  couple of times recently  so obviously we are not the only ones who were mislead by your marketingbusiness practices after getting the runaround for xxxx or so minutes my wife asked to speak to someone higher and was told xxxx was a supervisor and  as high as you get over the phone  she was then issued a differing address and fax number to the one i received \\nkeep in mind we wrote the check for on and paid the balance off on it today before calling your representatives had it been stated anywhere whatsoever on your paperwork that there was a fee associated with these checks we would never have written the check we would like the service fee  removed from our account as it was never made clear in your terms and conditions that this would be charged on anything but a balance transfer   \n",

       "29109  on sunday xxxxxxxx i visited a xxxx s restaurant for a late dinner after eating the dinner i realized i was xxxx xxxx   being very ill that evening with xxxx  and xxxx xxxx xxxx i called the next day to inform the restaurant manager who referred me to his regional manager the regional manager called and left me a message and i called several times to follow up leaving messages but never receiving a call back on wednesday xxxxxxxx i called my credit card company to inform them of the issue and they told me that they will place a hold on the charge and review it and to call back weeks later to follow up after calling back weeks later the same credit card company told me that they dont have any dispute on file that they do not permit their card holders to dispute anything against restaurants and hotels and there is nothing they can do for me in fact they only repeatedly stated that if the  service or product can not be returned in the same condition that it was provided to the customer that no dispute is permitted and the credit card will not act on my behalf  i informed them that this is contrary to the card policy in their attempt to recruit me as a customer  that they do protect their card holders from purchasing issues obviously any serious issues from hotels and restaurants are not protected for the service industry where there is high variability in quality and for those instances where a customer has been delivered compromised food andor service this policy does not protect consumers and rather gives little disincentive for restaurants to deliver subquality productsservice knowing that there are no consequences                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",

       "55772  jp morgan chase the issuer of my xxxx xxxx card charged me late fee because they claim i did not make the minimum payment of for the billing cycle ending xxxxxxxx on time this is a false claim my total balance for the previous cycle ending on xxxxxxxx was only but i paid meaning i had credit with chase to be applied for the next month xxxxxxxx chase recorded the payment on xxxxxxxx during the next cycle i used the card for other purchases for a total of chase applied the cash credit from previous cycle and my balance came to about so the of my money that i had at chase was used and credited toward my xxxxxxxx billing cycle therefore i had the peace of mind that i did not have to worry about the minimum payment and did not make one however chase still charged me late fee because they claim that even though they had my money and that money was used as a payment to my account that does not count as a payment this is unfair business practice and i am sure i am not the only victim of this kind of creative accounting by chase in my view since at the beginning of the billing cycle i did not owe anything on my account and actually chase owed me then they can not claim and late payment against me during the next cycle

they had the payment under review for xxxx and would not process until i provided his name address  both which they had  date of birth place of birth and nationality i explained i had no info and he was my newspaper carrier and wanted to know why after paying him for years every months this was necessary as i was authorizing this payment and it was being sent xxxx miles from my house as he provided me a service  delivering me a newspaper  again no answer was forthcoming and no payment has been sent i have called chase timesand received no satisfaction i understand the need to guard against money laundering but this is overboard  a repeating minimal payment i m authorizing and have authorized in the past which were processed without a problem sent locally feels like chase is either incompetent or engaging xxxx profiling i am filing this complaint because i received no answers from chase after multiple calls and a visit to the branch  the local xxxx ca branch attempted to be helpful but were stymied by corporate since i have received no satisfaction from chase regarding this i am filing this complaint

       "32316  in xxxx of xxxx i did a debt rollover from a xxxx  xxxx card in the amount of to my chase amazon prime visa card i have always paid off my current balance using the  pay off outstanding balance  setting i needed to change my setting to a monthly payment of since i didnt want to pay off the and i rarely go over that amount unfortunately chase started using a portion of my payment to reduce the amount of my rollover this resulted in them charging me interest on outstanding balances which should have been paid with my monthly payment of in xxxx they charged me interest on a balance of in the amount of my purchases for that month was less than the i paid the same thing happened in xxxx when i was charged interest on a balance even though my purchases were about my payment for that month was this increase in interest charges would have likely increased month after month as they were taking a portion of my payments to reduce my rollover amount even though no payment was due on that amount until xxxxxxxx \\ni am filing this complaint in order to start an investigation into their fraudulent practices or to warn other consumers to keep an eye on their balances \\ni did contact chase and they were able to credit me for the xxxx interest but not the previous fraudulent charges

       "70731  xxxxxxxx i entered into a loan modification agreement with chase bank  acct  xxxx  i was required to make a substantial first payment in the amount of with monthly payments to follow in the amount of per our agreement after seven  scheduled payments my monthly payment would be reduced dramatically to approximately per month as the loan would be  caught up  and normal monthly payments would resume \\ni was required to send certified funds each month of which i did from a local chase bank each payment was withdrawn and transferred by xxxx xxxx  relationship banker without fail on xxxxxxxx i received a letter from chase bank stating they were returning my payment of claiming i did not have an active payment plan on xxxxxxxx i brought the letter and the returned check into the chase branch and met with branch officer xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx contacted a bank representative xxxx xxxx and xxxx xxxx explained that chase bank was taking a  defensive  position due to a communication with xxxx xxxx my primary mortgage servicer xxxx xxxx explained that there was no documentation he could forward to confirm a communication with xxxx xxxx and also stated the second reason for my account being placed  inactive  was for nonpayment since xxxxxxxx xxxx xxxx did state he could nt understand why chase bank continued to accept my payments  xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx  after the account was suspended xxxxxxxx \\ni met with the local branch manager xxxx xxxx and after approximately one week of investigating the claim of nonpayment she was able to have my payments confirmed as being sent and recorded in my payment history there was never any mention of a  defensive position  \\nalthough i have made every payment on time and in accordance with the agreement chase bank did not reinstate the payment plan there was only one payment remaining before the loan would be reinstated in good standing and the much smaller payments would resume \\ni firmly believe this was deliberate and deceptive behavior on behalf of chase bank chase bank refused the final payment  of the trial period  under fictitious and false claims i am now being threatened by chase bank with possible foreclosure action and the request to start this process over again in order to avoid the action when chase bank has refused my payments this is criminal

       "75445  it is about chase auto loan payment reported to credit bureau at xxxxxxxx they said it was later over days \\n\\nsince i bought the car at xxxxxxxx i never received bills from them \\ni called in and paid my very first payment after that i told them that i never received any bill or letter from chase auto they told me it was automaticlly set as paper less \\ni was concerned that i told them my job requires me to travel all the time i do need to have physic letters sent to my apartment so my wife and parents can handle it as all the others bills i have \\n\\nbut still i never received the payment neither me or my family got one at all\\n\\ni paid several payment via phone back to xxxxxxxx after i paid via phone i told them i need to have physic letters from them and set me up as auto pay \\n\\nthe representative said they can help so they put me on hold for more than minutes and the call ended automatically \\n\\ni thought i have done the auto payment setup i still never received anything emails or phone call from chase auto \\n\\nat xxxxxxxx i received a phone call said i have a payment overdue for more than days i paid it off immediately i asked the rep how could that happened i never received bills via mail  i asked that times  and last time when i paid my bill the rep said they can set me up and put me on hold now they said auto pay can not be done unless i have an chase online account it is frustrated that i was informed they can set it up for me via phone but now they said it can only be done via phone \\n\\nalso during the period of the late payment i never received any information from them \\nbut they kept saying they did \\n\\nsince day one i never receive their letters for billing i had to call them by myself to solve the problem  i found the information via an app called xxxx xxxx

       "54061  none of the above no category fit my situation  i went default on a credit card in the amount of over with chase arrangements were made that the credit card company  chase  would take out a specific amount each month from my checking account as payment towards this debt at least years of payments were made to them in xxxx of i noticed that chase was not taking any payments i called and they said that they did not think that they would not get paid for a long time i could not afford the  xxxx they wanted so they decide to consider it a chargeoff i was giving them  xxxx i was paying them faithfully since they did not give me any written notice and they sent me a xxxx form i want to know whether they were legal in not notifying me that they were stopping collection of my payments maybe i could increase it a little \\ni want to know what my rights are here do they have the right to stop the payment arrangement with out written notice

notified about a problem with each of these payments until xxxx and they told me xxxx xxxx xxxx had paid them and then they  chase  had to refund them all back to xxxx xxxx xxxx when discussing this concern with xxxx xxxx xxxx they told me that chase had been informed within three days from the date that i had made the payments online xxxx  xxxx xxxx verified that automated clearing house  ach

       "30136  in xxxx of chase bank put a and a day late payment on my account this was a business account that was supposed to be closed in xxxx but due to some charges after our business closing which should have been denied the account got charged and became active again we closed the account because we had closed the business and since the business did not exist at the location anymore we did not receive any mail or bill so that we could pay this off on time in xxxx when i went into the bank i was told that i had this negative balance on this card which is now closed due to non payment and i started to pay the balance back down i have been a long time chase customer and have never had any issues with any payment and would request that this late payment be taken off my history this has been affecting my credit history and holding me back and has greatly affected my credit score

       "15459  we were approved for a repayment plan in xxxx and sent the acceptance form on our first payment was due on in the amount of which we paid on via payment over the phone with a chase bank representative we made the payment of on on xxxx xxxx we received an acceleration warning xxxx notice of intent to foreclose xxxx letter in the mail i contacted chase and they stated that they repayment plan had been canceled as they had not received the acceptance form i advised that we did sign that and fax it back to them they stated that there was nothing that they could do and i would have to apply again i requested to speak with a supervisor at this point i was transfered to xxxx xxxx who went over the same information with me and stated that she would see if they could reopen the repayment plan and asked me to fax the form that i had signed and sent to them in xxxx xxxx i refaxed this to them on i then received a call from xxxx on stating that she had discussed this with the managment in charge of the repayment plan and they stated that it could not be reopened and that we would need to go through the process again xxxx also stated that the acceptance form that i had sent back was not the document that they were looking for i advised her that this is the only document that i received that had to be sent back and had made the first payments and when i made these payments via phone with their representatives nobody told me that they were missing another form obviously if i was making the payments i would have sent the document that they wanted back therefore i must not have received it i asked if i could have a copy of the document that was supposed to be signed and sent back i was told that i could not have a copy of it how can i validate that i did or did not receive the document if i do not know what it looks like i was asked if she could have her manager call me back and i was advised that managers do not call customer s back and that i would have to be transferred to the executive office  i have talked with someone in the executive office in the past and they were not helpful at all  they always place the duty onto someone else and it is a

xxxx the seller provided screenshots of the tickets he claimed to have we agreed i would send the payment and he would transfer the tickets electronically all seemed normal and asked for the payment to be made through xxxx ive seen the commercial with the guy buying lemonade off some girls on a walk so i thought why not this should be straight forward enough and chase would have my back since

       "21398  around the end of after the first representative called me i explained my situation and how i became a dislocated worker he mentioned that i had a perfect payment history before this situation so he called he was calling to see how he can help after hearing my story he agreed that there wasnt anything he can do to help me and i told him that once i get my finances back in order i will continue my payments i also mentioned to him that i only really get enough to pay rent and not enough to pay my minimums he said he understood and i told him that i will get it together once i get a job and i also mentioned that i do not wish to be contacted again because its nothing that they can actually do to help me he said he understands and that was the end of the call so about two weeks later i started to receive more calls so after i became annoyed by the constant calling i asked another one of the calls and told the agent that i already spoke to a woman and explained to her that i already spoke to an agent about it and i did not want to be contacted again it so after a few more harrassment i answered and told the man to not contact me again and the this was harrassment he assured me that they would not contact me again so after a few weeks went past i started receiving about calls a day so i eventually blocked the number so they started calling me from different numbers which i all blocked they even started calling me on sunday and saturdays which i know its against the law to harass  someone on sundays all of this is making me never want to do business with this company ever again and i will be closing this account down soon and never doing business with chase again i can provide phone records from my cellphone provider is needed
